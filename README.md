# DEFNA

[Django Events Foundation of North America (DEFNA)][DEFNA] is a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in California USA. It was formed in 2015 at the request of the [Django Software Foundation (DSF)][DSF] to run [DjangoCon US][]. 

The DSF have licensed DEFNA to run DjangoCon US from 2015 to 2022, with an agreement that automatically renews unless otherwise informed. Beyond DjangoCon US, we also plan to be involved with other events in North America that cover the education and outreach of Django.
